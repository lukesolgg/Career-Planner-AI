     - **Target Job Title**

3. **Filling Out the Form:**
   - **Name:** Enter your full name or a pseudonym if you prefer anonymity.

### Tips for Using the Tool

- **Be Specific:** The more specific your current and target positions are, the more tailored the plan will be.

- **Use as a Guide:** Remember, this is a suggested path. Real-life career progression can vary based on numerous factors.

### Limitations
